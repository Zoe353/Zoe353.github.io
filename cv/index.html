				<h2>Education</h2>
				<p><strong>Georgia Tech, Atlanta, GA, 2019-2021</strong><br>
				<em>Master in Computer Science, GPA: 3.75</em> <!-- (PDF)</a> --></p>
				
				<p><strong>Beijing Jiaotong Univeristy, Beijing, China, 2015-2019</strong></p>
				<em> Bachelor in Software Engineering, GPA: 3.84, Graduated with Department Honors</em>
	
				<h2>Experience</h2>
				<p><strong>Full Stack Developer Intern; Institute of Software Chinese Academy of Sciences; Beijing, China, Oct. 2018- May 2019</strong></p>
				<ul>
				<li> Increased the working proficiency of our team by realizing a video annotation system, which could form the truth
data efficiently. This video annotation system was built by Django framework and MySQL database.</li>
				<li> Made the video annotation system compatible with python 2 and python 3 by upgrading the python version of the
original system; Adapted the system to infrared video by tuning the related parameters; Improved the evaluation
method of the trained models by adding different evaluation indications based on the tensorflow API.</li>
				</ul>
				
				<p><strong>Financial Intern, Agricultural Bank of China, Shandong, China, Jul. 2017- Aug. 2017</strong></p>
				<ul>
				<li>Learned fundamental knowledge of bank business; got involved in daily business of bank.</li> 
				<li>Summarized meeting; wrote business reports. </li>
				</ul>
				
				
				<h2>Projects</h2>
			        <p><strong>House Price Prediction</strong></p>
				<ul>
				<li>Generated a nice trained prediction system which could predict the house price at Atlanta to
help people get a reliable evaluated price. The generated process included four parts: Data scraping, Feature engineering,
Model training and Evaluation. Used ridge regression, random forest and DNN to do the separate training job. Used
ensemble method stacking to try to get the better performance.</li> 
				</ul>		
				<p><strong>TetRobot</strong></p>
				<ul>
				<li>Simulated a TetRobot which has a tetrahedron body and four corresponding legs and could be controlled by
desired path or keyboard input. Also made the robot be compatible with the physics by rolling the robot during each
move and ensuring that the moving foot arrived on the ground with zero absolute velocity and vertical acceleration.
</li> 
				</ul>
				<p><strong>Restaurant Recommendation System</strong></p>
				<ul>
				<li>Generated a restaurant recommendation system, which could recommend the
restaurants according to their preference. Used collaborative filtering algorithm based on users to recommend
restaurants; Displayed restaurants using different filters. Accumulated calculating speed using spark. Assisted to finish
the User Manual, manage the defect management.</li> 
				</ul>	
				<p><strong>2018 Mathematical Contest in Modeling of America, Meritorious Winner</strong></p>
				<ul>
				<li>Analyzed the energy profile for each
state and Generated a statistical prediction of the energy profile of each state.</li> 
				</ul>
