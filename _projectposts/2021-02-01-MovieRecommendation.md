##### Description of Problem
Inspired by online streaming platforms like Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, Youtube, etc.
Those recommendation services provide recommendation based on user preference
and browse history.

##### Project Overview
Our objective is to develop a movie recommendation system using collaborative
filtering techniques. The model should be secure, and able to make both general and
personalized recommendations. As a proof of concept, we expect to develop a
website to demonstrate how the model works. Analysis and comparisons with some
existing models are to be performed as well.
