##### Description of Problem
Music as a form of art and recreation has been popular among people for centuries.Recent development of the Internet has greatly facilitated the growth of online ratings
for songs. Due to the gigantic amount of songs, it appears to be hard to find songs to
oneâ€™s taste.

##### Project Overview
Our objective is to develop a songs recommendation system using collaborative
filtering techniques. The model should be secure, and able to make both general and
personalized recommendations. As a proof of concept, we expect to develop a
website to demonstrate how the model works. Analysis and comparisons with some
existing models are to be performed as well.
