##### Project Description
The goal is to design and implement a modeling and animation system that lets the user program the 
motion of a simplified TetRobot or control it interactively with keys or with the mouse. We started by paving the 
floor path with equilateral-triangle tiles. Then, we implemented rolling a regular tetrahedron from one tile to the next one.
The body of the robot will be the core at the center of the moving tetrahedron. Finally, we added the legs
that connect the robot to tile corners.

##### Working Phases
###### Phase1: Triangular tilling of path and CEH
Start with the given Processing sketch which has a TETROBOT CLASS and a few methods for placing the initial tile (equilateral triangle), for showing
its tile and its tetrahefron. Let the user create a string of S of character in {R, O, L}, either by pressing the 'R', 'O', 'L' keys or by reading the string from the clipboard and 
controlling the step-counter k. I should be able to show the first k tiles, and the tetrahedron on the last one. Also, I should be able to show the "ghost" tetrahedron for the previous tiles with opacity decreasing with 
"age" and may provide a "mouse-based control" that appends the proper character to S, based on the position of the mouse (treated as an attractor), when the "*" keys is pressed.

###### Phase 2: Rolling Tetrahedron the TetRobot core
* Roll the tetrahedron during each move  
During the time allocated to the move from one tile to the next one, you should pivot the current regular tetrahedron (CRT) at constant angular
velocity around the edge between the adjacent tiles.Show the continuous animation for all the tiles defined by the current string S. Use 'r' to reset the CRT 
to its initial position and 'g' (meaning "go") to start rolling. Provide the option to show/hide the tiles ('#') and the correspnding past tetrahedron ('^').
* Show TetRobot body
To obtain the body of the TetRobot, shrink the CRT around its centroid to about 1/4 of its size and add 4 balls at its corner, which will be the hips to which the legs will be attached.
Provide the option ('b') to show/hide the body.
* Magical legs
Add a first draft of legs (toggled by 'l') that shows each legs as a straight "caplet" between the hip and the corresponding tile-corner, when the foot of that leg is on the floor. So, the leg will
disappear, when is end-effector is in the air and will reappear when its has reached its destination. The path of this free leg will be implemented in the next phase. Moving foot arrives on the ground with zero absolute velocity and only
vertical acceleration.

###### Phase 3: Bending leg
* Trajectory of the foot of the free leg
The foot-motion starts at the opposite corner of the PET and will end at the opposite corner of the NET. Design the time-parameterized motion of that free-foot between these two places.
* Bending the legs
Assume that each leg is defined by three corresponding spheres: H at its hip (of radius r), K at its knee (of radius 2r/3), and F at its foot (of radius r/3).
* Path of flying foot
Modify the path of the flying foot so that it is a semi-circle or a semi-ellipse in a vertical plane. Ensure soft (zero-velocity) lift and landing.

###### Phase 4: Dancing TetRobot
Improve the aesthetics of the free-foot motion, add some dynamic for a walk with more character.
