##### Project Description
The goal is to design and implement a modeling and animation system that lets the user program the 
motion of a simplified TetRobot or control it interactively with keys or with the mouse. We started by paving the 
floor path with equilateral-triangle tiles. Then, we implemented rolling a regular tetrahedron from one tile to the next one.
The body of the robot will be the core at the center of the moving tetrahedron. Finally, we added the legs
that connect the robot to tile corners.
