##### Description of Problem
For many non-designers/young designers(and even experienced designers), picking and using
fonts for their projects becomes a hard task. According to our research, currently, people either
choose fonts based on search results of existed design works, font tools (for example, Google
fonts) and the endless mix & match try-out of fonts in design software. However, we found out:
1) People are having difficulties doing font research, selection, and pairing.
2) Typographic literacy and appreciation are lacking in the mentioned process above. As a
powerful tool and component in design, typography receives very limited attention. Even when
people are using certain fonts in their projects already, without learning its context, they might
not be able to perceive what the typography connotes nor appreciate the effort made by font
designers.

##### Project Overview  
We are trying to look into the patterns of diversified font usage, with the intention to create an integrated visualization that explores how often fonts are used together over time with additional information of the font contexts to provide design insights
