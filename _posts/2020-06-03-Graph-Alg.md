This is blog is used to record the graph algorithms. Let's start with the DFS and BFS algorithm, which are used very common in the graph problems.

DFS:
1. check if a graph is connected and more generally, to assign each node v an integer ccnum[v] identifying the connected components to which it belongs.
2. test for acyclicity in linear time. If the graph is a DAG, we would like if posible to linearize or topologically sort it. In a DAG, every edge leads to a vertex with a lowest post number.
3. strongly connected components: every directed graph is a dag of its strongly connected components.

BFS:
1. find shortest path(in the graph with unit edges)
2. the adaptation of BFS-Dijikstra's Alg- find shortest path (edge lengths are positive integers)
3. Bellman-ford Alg(findsingle source shortest paths in general graphs; also can detect negative cycles by performing one extra round)
