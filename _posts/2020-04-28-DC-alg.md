Hi, this blog is to record some stuff about Divide and Conquer.

D&C Strategy
a. Breaking it into subproblems that are themselves smaller instances of the same type of problem.
b. Recursively solving these subproblems.
c. Appropriately combining their answers.

Some algorithms that applies the idea of D&C:

1. Binary Search (To find a key in a large file containing keys $Z[0,1,...,n-1]$ in sorted order)
2. Merge Sort(*): split the list into two halves, recusively sort each half, and then merge the two sorted sublists.
3. Selection(The generalization of finding the medians)  
Input: A list of number $S$; an integer $k$  
Output: The kth smallest element of $S$  
Solution: For any number $v$, imagine splitting list $S$ into three categories: elements smaller than $v$, those equal to
 $v$(there might be duplicates), and those greater than $v$. Call these $S_L, S_v, and S_R$ respectively.  
$$
Selection(S,k)=
\begin{cases}
Selection(S_L,k) if k < |S_L| \\
v if |S_L| < k < |S_L| + |S_v| \\
Selection(S_R, k-|S_L|-|S_v|) if k > |S_L| + |S_v|
\end{cases}
$$  
How to choose v? we just choose $v$ randomly from $S$  
We will call v good if it lies within the 25th to 75th percentile of the array  
$T(n) \leq T(3n/4) + O(n) \rightarrow O(n)$  
4. FFT(Fast Fourier Transform)
