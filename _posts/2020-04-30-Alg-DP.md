Hi, this blog to record some common DP problems, just in case I forget sometimes.

1.LIS-Longest Increasing Sequence  
Def: A subsequence of a sequence $A = [ a_1, a_2, ..., a_n ]$ is $[ a_{l1}, a_{l2}, ..., a_{lk} ]$ such that $l1 < l2 < ... <lk $.  
Def: A sequence ${a_1, a_2, ..., a_n}$ is increasing if $a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n$.  
<hr />
Input: $A = [ a_1, a_2, ..., a_n]$  
Output: length of the LIS  
<hr />  
Step1: "Define your table with words"  
$T(i)$ is the len of LIS of $[a_0, a_1, ..., a_i]$ ending exactly at $a_i$ !!!  
Step2: "Write a recursive relation to fill the table"  
$$T(i)=
\begin{cases}
MAX \{ 1+T(j), T(i) \}, if a_j < a_i \\
1, else 
\end{cases}$$  
Step3:"Write ** for the design"  
For $i = 1$ to $n$  
\quad $T(i) = 1$  
For $i = 2$ to $n$  
\quad For $j = 1$ to $i-1$  
\quad \quad if $a_j < a_i$ AND $T(i) < 1+ T(j)$
\quad \quad \qquad $T(i) = 1+ T(j)$
$MAX = 1$  
For $i = 1$ to $n$  
\quad If $T(i) > MAX$: $MAX = T(i)$  
Step4: Analysis the running time of your algorithm  
$O(n^2)$ given by two nested loops of len $n$ each.

2.LCS-Longest Common Subsequence  
Step1: $T(i,j) = $ the len of the LCS of $X[ 1:i ]$  and $Y[ 1:j ]$
