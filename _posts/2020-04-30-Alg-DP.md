Hi, this blog to record some common DP problems, just in case I forget sometimes.

1.LIS-Longest Increasing Sequence  
Def: A subsequence of a sequence $A = [ a_1, a_2, ..., a_n ]$ is $[ a_{l1}, a_{l2}, ..., a_{lk} ]$ such that $l1 < l2 < ... <lk $.  
Def: A sequence ${a_1, a_2, ..., a_n}$ is increasing if $a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n$.  
Input: $A = [ a_1, a_2, ..., a_n]$  
Output: length of the LIS    
<em>Step1</em>: "Define your table with words"  
$T(i)$ is the len of LIS of $[a_0, a_1, ..., a_i]$ ending exactly at $a_i$ !!!  
<em>Step2</em>: "Write a recursive relation to fill the table"  
$$T(i)=
\begin{cases}
MAX \{ 1+T(j), T(i) \}, if a_j < a_i \\
1, else 
\end{cases}$$  
<em>Step3</em>:"Write ** for the design"  
Just skip that part for convenience.
<em>Step4</em>: Analysis the running time of your algorithm  
$O(n^2)$ given by two nested loops of len $n$ each.

2.LCS-Longest Common Subsequence  
<em>Step1</em>: $T(i,j) = $ the len of the LCS of $X[ 1:i ]$  and $Y[ 1:j ]$  
<em>Step2</em>: 
$$T(i,j) = 
\begin{cases}
MAX(T(i,j-1), T(i-1,j)), if x[ i ] \neq y[ j ] \\
1+ T(i-1,j-1), if x[ i ] == y[ j ]
\end{cases}
$$
